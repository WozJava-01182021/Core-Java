## Repo Structure

Please create a branch to keep your personal files, so we do not overwrite anyones work. Let me know if you want me: [rukshanuddin](http://github.com/rukshanuddin) to create a branch for you. We will figure out how to update main as the class progresses... I was thinking once a week.
